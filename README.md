## 🧠 Overview

**VeraCrypt** is a Windows-oriented encryption utility created to help users protect sensitive information at the storage level. It enables the creation of encrypted containers and secured drives that keep data isolated from unauthorized access when not in use.

The application follows a logical and transparent workflow. Encrypted volumes can be mounted as virtual drives, allowing users to work with protected files in a familiar way. Once the volume is closed, all stored data becomes inaccessible and unreadable, ensuring consistent protection outside of active sessions.

VeraCrypt is well suited for users who need a dependable and methodical approach to safeguarding information. Its emphasis on clarity, control, and repeatable processes makes it a reliable tool for managing protected data on Windows systems.
